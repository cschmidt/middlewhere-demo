Test Console
------------
 - measure preconditions
   - network characteristics
   - disk io characteristics
   - cpu profile (some sort of benchmark)
    
 - selectable task slots, # threads of each
    - for example, want to run 20 DeadlockOnRead threads with 5 SimpleDeadlock threads
 - measurements
   - count # deadlocks in server logs
      - remote log listener?
   - cpu, network, disk utilization of system under test
      - directly read /proc via ssh?  parse vmstat output?
   - # of task executions and time taken
 - automatic mode
    - run a particular mix of tasks until a particular threshold is reached
       - max CPU
       - # deadlocks in the logs
    - define a timeout (don't wait forever if the target condition is not reached)


SimpleOptimizer
 - sample some measurements, with defined thresholds at a particular frequency
 - increase one variable until one or more of the thresholds are exceeded

 
Test Definition
-------------


Groovy-based scripting?
 - define JNDI names to expose to script
 - how to get the client classes?
 - web services?
     
Get a bean shell server going

Keep calling until you get a deadlock, to a maximum of 'x' calls OR
Call 'x' times and count the deadlocks


Test cases
 - reading with and without JBoss read-only true
 - doing lots of work with lots of remote calls vs. batching up request objects
     - simulate with different network speeds?
 - basic deadlock
 - find entity A, find entity B, etc
 - CMR reads
 - transaction timeouts
 - various transaction attributes
 - caching
 - performance tests
    - reads
    - updates
    - inserts

Installation and Setup
 - enable the EntityLockMonitor in jboss-service.xml (maybe just deploy it on it's own?)


Sample Test Plan 1
---------------
 - start jboss
 - deploy middlewhere

 - run simple deadlock test, count # deadlocks
 - expect at least 1 deadlock



 Requirements
  - JBoss 4.2.2.GA
  - Java 1.5+

 Configuration
  - JBOSS_HOME
  - JAVA_HOME?
